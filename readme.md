## Description
A Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. 

Because testing is key to making code maintainable, I have written unit tests for each part of my code and ensured that it passes all of them. The tests include validation to ensure that user input provided is in the proper expected format.

 The application uses Jest for running the unit tests and Inquirer version 8.2.4 for collecting input from the user.
