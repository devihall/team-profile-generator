What the project does
A Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Because testing is key to making code maintainable, I have written unit tests for each part of my code and ensured that it passes all of them.

Why the project is useful
The project is useful for a manager that wants to generate a webpage that displays their team's basic info, so they have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles.
